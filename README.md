# Play-Green
 ##  How to see the project locally 

You will need to have node.js installed, starting from version 14, and have access to a terminal to follow these steps:
>
1. We need to clone the project by adding the following command line in a terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/tarrifa/Play-Green.git
```
2. We enter the folder that we just cloned and install the necessary dependencies
arduino
```
npm install
#
yarn
```
>
3. Access the play green folder where the project lives
```
cd play-green/

```
3. We run our project locally
```
npm start
#
yarn start
```
